Banking Backend Design Overview
1. Requirements Gathering:

    Functional Requirements:
        Account management, transfers, deposits, withdrawals, loan applications, etc.
    Non-Functional Requirements:
        Scalability, performance, security.

2. High-Level Architecture:

    Microservices Architecture:
        Account Service: Manages account data.
        Transaction Service: Manages transactions.
        Customer Service: Handles customer profiles.
        Loan Service: Manages loan applications.
        Notification Service: Handles customer communication.
        Audit Service: Monitors system actions.

3. Data Management:

    Database Selection:
        Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) for transactional data.
        NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for unstructured data.
    Data Encryption: Use tools like AWS KMS.
    Database Backups: Regular backups and disaster recovery.

4. Security:

    Authentication & Authorization:
        2FA and role-based access control.
    Data Encryption:
        Use TLS for data in transit.
    Regular Audits:
        Security audits and penetration tests.
    Anomaly Detection: Monitor for unusual activities.
    API Security:
        Rate limiting, CORS.

5. Scalability & Resilience:

    Load Balancers: Distribute incoming traffic.
    Auto-Scaling: Adjust based on load.
    Circuit Breakers: Halt operations during failures.

6. Development & Deployment:

    CI/CD: Automatic testing and deployment.
    Environment Isolation: Separate environments (dev, test, prod).

7. Monitoring & Logging:

    Monitoring Tools:
        Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana.
    Log Management:
        Use tools like ELK Stack or Splunk.

8. APIs and Integration:

    Open API Standards:
        RESTful APIs or GraphQL.
    Versioning: Ensure backward compatibility.

9. Backup & Recovery:

    Regular Backups: Off-site backups.
    Disaster Recovery: Plans and protocols.

10. Regulatory Compliance:

    Local Regulations: Comply with local laws.
    Data Residency: Store data as per regulations.

11. Testing:

    Unit Testing: For individual components.
    Integration Testing: For service interactions.
    End-to-End Testing: For the entire system.
    Load & Stress Testing: For peak activity.
