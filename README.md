  - Provide data analytics and business intelligence capabilities
  - Offer tools for data visualization and insights

### Infrastructure Considerations:
- **Deployment:** Containerized services (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes)
- **Database Management:** Separate databases for services, ensuring data isolation and integrity
- **Service Communication:** Use of API Gateways and Service Mesh (e.g., Istio) for inter-service communication
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Centralized logging and monitoring systems to track activities across services
- **Scaling & Load Balancing:** Infrastructure provisions to scale services based on demand and distribute traffic

# Data Management for Banking Backend

## Database Selection:

### 1. Relational Databases (RDBMS):
- **Examples:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server
- **Usage:**
  - Storing transactional data
  - Managing accounts, customer profiles, and loans
  - Handling structured data with relations

### 2. NoSQL Databases:
- **Examples:** MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Couchbase
- **Usage:**
  - Logging and audit trails
  - Handling semi-structured or unstructured data
  - Storing data with high write rates or scalability needs (e.g., notifications, real-time analytics)

## Data Encryption:

### 1. Data at Rest:
- **Tools:** AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in RDBMS
- **Purpose:**
  - Encrypt data stored in databases, backups, logs
  - Ensure protection against unauthorized data access

### 2. Data in Transit:
- **Protocols:** TLS, HTTPS
- **Purpose:**
  - Secure data being transmitted between services, databases, or external systems
  - Ensure data integrity and confidentiality during transit

## Database Backups:

### 1. Backup Strategies:
- **Full Backups:** Regular snapshots of the entire database
- **Incremental Backups:** Store changes since the last full or incremental backup
- **Differential Backups:** Store changes since the last full backup

### 2. Backup Storage:
- **Local Backups:** Stored within the same infrastructure or data center
- **Off-Site Backups:** Stored in a different geographical location to ensure data safety against localized incidents

### 3. Backup Scheduling:
- Determine frequency based on:
  - Business requirements
  - Data volume and change rate
  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

### 4. Restoration:
- **Test Regularly:** Ensure backup integrity and restoration process
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Measure the maximum acceptable time to restore from backup

## Data Redundancy & Replication:

### 1. Master-Slave Replication:
- **Purpose:** Distribute read queries, ensure high availability, create backup nodes
- **Implementation:** Primary database (master) replicates data to one or more secondary databases (slaves)

### 2. Multi-Master Replication:
- **Purpose:** Allow data writes in multiple locations, especially in distributed systems
- **Considerations:** Handle conflicts and ensure data consistency

## Data Archiving:

### 1. Strategy:
- Move older, less frequently accessed data to cheaper storage solutions
- Ensure the data remains accessible for regulatory or business needs

### 2. Tools:
- Solutions like AWS Glacier, Azure Blob Storage (cool tier), or dedicated archiving systems
